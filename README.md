# Coding test for Go developers: In-memory data structure store

Need to implement simple in-memory data structure store. See Redis for example.

Required data strutures:
- Strings
- Lists

Required operations:
- Get
- Set
- Update
- Remove
- Push for lists
- Pop for lists

Required features:
- Keys with a limited TTL
- Go client API library
- HTTP REST API

Add unit tests for Go API and integration tests for REST API (without full coverage, just for example).
Provide REST API specs with examples, client library API docs and deployment docs (for Docker).

Optional features:
- Data persistence
- Perfomance tests
- Authentication
